    <h2>The Tiberian Journals</h2>
    <p><em>"I cannot authenticate every detail. But I believe this voice is real. Whoever he was, he was not one of the great names. But he was there. These are the remains of one man’s reckoning. They were not meant for us to read."</em> —L.D.C.</p>

    <p><strong>Found where no eyes were left to see</strong>, <em>The Tiberian Journals</em> offers a disturbing, fragmentary glimpse into the final days of Tiberius’s reign. Bound in fire-damaged leather and wrapped in wax paper, the codex was delivered without attribution. What followed has become one of the most fiercely debated recoveries in classical literature.</p>

    <p>This edition includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Newly discovered footnotes (some of which appear inconsistently across printings)</li>
      <li>An annotated introduction and afterword by Dr. Linus D. Calvert (University of Exeter)</li>
      <li>A second afterword and editorial intervention by Dr. Aurelia M. Stanton (King’s College London)</li>
      <li>Facsimiles of mirror inscriptions, cloaked figures, and sealed scrolls</li>
      <li>Redacted inventory fragments and registry irregularities</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Crux Archive Editions</em> exists to preserve the apocrypha of history—the texts too unstable for tradition, too infected by proximity to power.</p>
